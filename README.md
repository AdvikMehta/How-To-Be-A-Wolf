# Stochastic-Predator-Prey-Simulation
An AI simulates the life of a wolf in an isolated ecosystem with prey.
This project is a predecessor to my Targeted Predator-Prey Simulation Project. Here, the prey (deer) move randomly and not away from the predator.
In targeted simulation, prey move away from the wolf as well as show flocking behaviour as displayed in real life by animals like zebra, wildebeast, deer, etc.
